// 1. Create a function that takes an array of numbers and returns the max number in the array.
console.log(Math.max.apply(null, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]));
// //This method is called the Javascript function which allows you to find the maximum number in an array.

console.log(Math.min.apply(null, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]));
// //This method is called the Javascript function which allows you to find the maximum number in an array.
//3. Create a function that takes an array of numbers and returns the sum of all the numbers in the array.
